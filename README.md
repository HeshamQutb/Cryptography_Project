# Secure File Encryption and Decryption with User-Friendly Interface

## Project Description

This project is an advanced file encryption and decryption application that prioritizes user experience and security. It offers a suite of four robust encryption algorithms: Caesar Cipher, OTP (One-Time Pad), Substitution Cipher, and Base64. Each algorithm is presented with a dedicated user interface to streamline usage. Users can encrypt and decrypt both plain text and files, ensuring data confidentiality. The application also facilitates the saving of encrypted/decrypted files for future reference.

## Key Features

- **Multiple Encryption Algorithms:** Employs four distinct encryption algorithms to cater to different security requirements and preferences.
- **Intuitive User Interfaces:** Provides separate, intuitive user interfaces for each encryption algorithm, ensuring a seamless user experience and ease of navigation.
- **Text and File Handling:** Accommodates both plain text input and file selection for encryption or decryption. This feature enhances versatility and usability by allowing users to encrypt/decrypt various types of data.
- **File Management:** Enables users to save the results of encryption/decryption operations to files, empowering them to securely store sensitive information and access it conveniently when needed.
- **Security Measures:** Implements robust encryption techniques to safeguard data confidentiality and integrity, ensuring that sensitive information remains protected against unauthorized access or interception.
- **Customization Options:** Offers users the flexibility to specify encryption keys or passphrases, empowering them to customize their security settings according to their unique requirements and preferences.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    https://github.com/HeshamQutb/Cryptography_Project.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd Cryptography_Project
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Launch the application by running the main script:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2. Choose the desired encryption algorithm from the provided options.
3. Utilize the intuitive user interface to perform encryption and decryption operations:
   - Input plain text directly into the designated text area.
   - Select files for encryption/decryption using the file upload/download buttons.
   - Initiate encryption/decryption processes with the corresponding buttons.
   - Optionally specify encryption keys or passphrases for enhanced security.
4. Save encrypted/decrypted files using the "Save Result" button for future reference and secure storage.
